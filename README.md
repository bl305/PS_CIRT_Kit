Powershell CIRT kit

From my old website 02/19/2017.
Again, I'm not a Powershell expert, not a programmer, so this code is not nice. But works for me.

This tool is a Powershell script for managing some Incident response process. I have created this to help automate the common tasks. It is actually not only for CIRT, but for IT operations and troubleshooting also.
